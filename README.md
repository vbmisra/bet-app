# project-3

## Overview

Welcome to your third and final group project! This project serves as your best opportunity to showcase all the skills youâ€™ve learned throughout this course and collaborate with the community of developers youâ€™ve cultivated over the past six months. Youâ€™ll work with your group to build a performant and scalable MERN stack single-page application that fulfills a real-world need, with a focus on data and user demand.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* Full-stack MERN applications

* [Git branching workflow](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows)

* [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

* Collaborative development

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

* Resolve merge conflicts

* Explain agile software development

* Design, build and deploy a full-stack MERN application to Heroku

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

## Homework

With your group, youâ€™ll again conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. In creating your first collaborative MERN stack single-page application, youâ€™ll combine a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. Youâ€™ll continue to build on the agile development methodologies youâ€™ve used throughout this course. These include storing your project code in GitHub, managing your work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

For this project, you should start from scratch. Doing so will allow you to revisit your front-end abilities in the context of React and solidify your understanding of working with multiple servers in a MERN application. Your skills have continued to improve since the first two projects, so naturally your approach will be different considering the experience youâ€™ve gained with each new application youâ€™ve built.

## Heads-Up

In the next unit, you'll continue to work on your final projects. You'll end the week by presenting your project to your class. Once your project is complete, you'll want to update your professional materials and add your new project to your portfolio.
